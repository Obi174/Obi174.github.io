        Six hundred deaths under my command
        'Cause I had one goal in mind
        No fleet, no band
        Only this raft that I made by hand
        How will I reach my homeland?
        All you have to do is not open this bag
        Hermes?
        Hello, old friend
        So you're the one who talked to Calypso?
        Why are you here?
        You're being given a final option
        Consider this your one last chance
        To make it back home and abandon caution
        Wash it away like the blood your hands have known
        I know if you dance with fate
        Then I know, I know you'll enhance your state
        If your plan's so great then why'd you wait to say it?
        Well, it's a little bit dangerous, my friend
        You'll need a mindset change for this
        You cannot get away with playing safe for this
        You wanna get home?
        Put it all on the line
        And put your whole brain in it
        Remember every trick in your domain for this
        You gotta treat it like it is the main event
        You wanna get home?
        Put it all on the line
        Be dangerous
        Alright, I'm in, what do I do?
        First stop, uncharted waters
        When lost, look towards the sky
        Follow the north star
        No matter how far
        You think you're going, you keep on rowing
        When strangers lurk around the isle
        When danger greets you with a smile
        Fight your way through, do what you must do
        But no matter what, keep moving
        It's gonna be dangerous, my friend
        You'll need a mindset change for this
        You cannot get away with playing safe for this
        You wanna get home?
        Put it all on the line
        And put your whole brain in it
        Remember every trick in your domain for this
        You gotta treat it like it is the main event
        You wanna get home?
        Put it all on the line
        Be dangerous
        And lastly, the wind bag
        We went through so much to get this
        Keep this bag closed if you wanna get home, sir
        You won't get another time to try
        The raging storm inside won't let you get closer
        It was meant to stop you by design
        'Cause no mortal can pass Poseidon's storm
        Open this bag, and you'll never make it home
        You'll never make it home
        Don't you know that danger is my friend?
        My whole life, I've trained for this
        I cannot tell you how much I have paid for this
        I have to get home, put it all on the line
        I'm gonna use ruthlessness
        Every trick, every skill put to use for this
        I plan to put an end to all the foolishness
        I have to get home, put it all on the line
        I'll be dangerous
        Hermes
        Thank you
        Don't thank me, friend
        I'm not the one who fought for you
        Then who?
        Good luck</marquee>
